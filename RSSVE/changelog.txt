    * Many small tweaks to the atmospheric scatter effects of all bodies.
    * Increased the apparent brightness of the Moon (might still need some tweaking).

    * Remade and simplified the Earth aurora main and detail textures.
    * The Earth aurora is now less visible in the daylight.
    * Removed an old and unused Earth cloud main texture.
    * Removed the Earth PQS texture (was a performance hog and did not look good anyway).
    * Re-factored the file and folder structure to ease management and development.
    * New binary assemblies for KSP 1.1.3 users (for use with Scatterer v0.255).

Bug Fixes:

    * None so far.
