RSSVE v1.2.2-RC4 for KSP 1.2.2 (2017-07-XX)
==================================================

Change Log:

    • Compatibility update for the Scatterer v0.0320 release.
    • Enabled the Scatterer cloud integration and ring shadow features.
    • Rebuilt all Scatterer profiles from scratch (courtesy of RSSVE collaborator Theysen).
    • Added detail surface textures to Earth and Triton.
    • Updated the aurora texture map for Earth.
    • Increased the transparency of the Titan cloud texture map.
    • Updated the cloud texture maps for Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
    • Added a custom Saturn ring texture for the new ring shadow feature.
    • Fixed the altitude of the gas giants cloud layers (still wrong by a factor of ten though).
    • Improved the appearance and overall performance impact of the volumetric clouds.
    • Improved the appearance of the city day and night detail texture maps.
    • Added some missing volumetric clouds to Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
    • Tweaked the apparent brightness and movement of the Earth auroras.
    • Reduced the apparent brightness of the Earth surface from orbit.
    • Tweaked the apparent light levels on the surface of Venus.

Bug Fixes:

    • Eliminated the ground flickering on Earth.
    • Fixed the Earth cloud clipping for altitudes less than 167 km.

Known Issues:

    • The city lights may appear blocky from low altitudes.
    • The transitioning between PQS and ScaledSpace is not as soft as it should.
    • If a save reload in-flight is done then the cloud texture maps will break.
    • The Uranus ring may appear out of place sometimes.
    • Some of the bodies may appear as featureless spheres under DirextX 11 or OpenGL.

RSSVE v1.2.2-RC3 for KSP 1.2.2 (2017-02-26)
==================================================

Change Log:

    • Compatibility update for the Scatterer v0.0300 release.
    • Many small tweaks to the atmospheric scatter effects of all bodies.
    • Increased the apparent brightness of the Moon (might still need some tweaking).
    • Titan will now appear less bright and saturated than before.
    • Remade and simplified the Earth aurora main and detail textures.
    • The Earth aurora is now less visible in the daylight.
    • Removed an old and unused Earth cloud main texture.
    • Removed the Earth PQS texture (was a performance hog and did not look good anyway).
    • Re-factored the file and folder structure to ease management and development.
    • New binary assemblies for KSP 1.1.3 users (for use with EVE 1.1-3 and Scatterer v0.0255).

Bug Fixes:

    • None so far.

Known Issues:

    • The city lights may appear to fade in/out or flicker.
    • The new Scatterer cloud integration and Kopernicus ring shader features are currently disabled.
    • The bodies may appear as featureless spheres under DirextX 11 or OpenGL. A hotfix patch has been issued as a temporary solution.
